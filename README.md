Twitter Sentiment Analysis Model


This repository contains a Twitter sentiment analysis model developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a logistic regression machine learning algorithm.


Overview
Twitter sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a tweet, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. This model aims to predict the sentiment of tweets using a logistic regression classifier trained on labeled Twitter data.


Features
Utilizes NLP techniques such as stemming, stopwords removal, and tokenization to preprocess and extract features from raw text data.


Implements a logistic regression classifier for sentiment analysis.
Provides functionalities to train the model, perform inference on new tweets, and evaluate model performance.
Saves the trained model for future use and allows real-time prediction on user input.
Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
NumPy
Pandas
You can install the dependencies via pip:


Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
Install Dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the Model:

Run the train.py script to train the logistic regression model on labeled Twitter data.

Copy code
python train.py
Perform Inference:

Use the trained model to perform sentiment analysis on new tweets. Modify predict.py to load the trained model and perform inference on new data.

Copy code
python predict.py
Evaluate Model Performance:

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can modify evaluate.py to compute these metrics.

Copy code
python evaluate.py
Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled Twitter dataset containing tweets annotated with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). Ensure that you have a similar dataset for training the model.

Real-time Prediction
The model allows real-time prediction on user input. Run the predict_user_input.py script to enter a tweet and get its sentiment prediction instantly.
